        We are in the early stages of product development and can envision several use cases for this type of solution.
        <ol>
            <li>
                Endpoint toggles - disable or reroute endpoints on the fly for beta features or when application and performance issues arise.
            </li>
            <li>
                Chaos engineering - automated chaos engineering testing framework.
            </li>
            <li>
                Logging toggles - increase and decrease logging or add and remove log statements dynamically without deployment and restarting applications.
            </li>
            <li>
                Automatic documentation generation, as well as endpoint detection.
            </li>
            <li>
                Low code feature flags - low code alternative to traditional feature flag toggles.
            </li>
        </ol>

        We would love to hear any feedback (positive and negative) or other use case ideas. The future direction of facet will be directly impacted by YOUR feedback!
