                        Facet enables engineers to toggle (enable & disable) endpoints in production and other user-defined environments. At facet, we believe that engineers shouldn't spend their time maintaining manual configurations and re-deploying their applications everytime an critical-error occurs. We enable engineers to focus on building their product, while we build the endpoint management abstractions to support them throughout the journey.
                        Some common usecases of Facet include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Testing new features that may be not 100% reliable.</li>
                            <li>Measuring application reliability.</li>

                        A facet is a set elements that construe a feature. For instance, a login form could be considered a facet, with the elements being email, password and the login button.
                        In terms of backend applications, a facet is any method that's declared within the codebase.
