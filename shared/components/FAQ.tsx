                        Facet abstracts the feature management process that is commonly achieved by using feature flags. At facet, we believe that engineers shouldn't spend their time maintaining manual configurations. We enable engineers to focus on building their product, while we build the feature management abstractions to support them throughout the journey.

                        A facet is a set elements that construe a feature. For instance, a login form could be considered a facet, with the elements being email, password and the login button.
                        In terms of backend applications, a facet is any method that's declared within the codebase.
