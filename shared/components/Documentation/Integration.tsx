            Copy the snippet of code generated by the facet extension and displayed at the top of the extension (show img here..).
            This is the single line of code you need to paste into your  <pre><code>head</code></pre> HTML code. Once this line of code is integrated in your system, you will be able to use facets in production.
            <pre><code>
                {preCodeValue}
            </code></pre>
            <FacetLabel fontSize={fontSize.small} text="Note: ID is automatically generated from the facet extension" />
            Note that you would need to embed the script tag as early as your application loads, to ensure correct DOM dismissal before the elements are loaded on the page.
    </FacetParagraph>
