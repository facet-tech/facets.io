            A facet is a group of elements that make up a feature. For instance, a login form can be a facet with the elements being “username” and “password”.
            <br />
            <br />
            Creating/Reading/Updating/Deleting (CRUDing) facets is achieved by using the facet extension. The user interface of the facet extension is a sidebar that loads on the left. Start creating facets by clicking on the edit icon (
            <Icon
                iconWidth="20"
                iconHeight="15"
                fill={color.grayA}
                name="edit"
                title="Settings" />
            ) on the top navigation bar of the extension. To declare a facet, hover your mouse over the webpage and select elements of interest by clicking on them. By clicking on the display/hide icon
            (<Icon
                iconWidth="20"
                iconHeight="15"
                fill={color.grayA}
                name="eye-outline"
                title="Settings" />)
                next to each facet, you can toggle each facet.
                You can rename and delete a facet by clicking on (
            <Icon
                iconWidth="20"
                iconHeight="15"
                fill={color.grayA}
                name="more-vertical-outline"
                title="Settings" />).

            To create a new facet, click on the (
            <Icon
                iconWidth="20"
                iconHeight="15"
                fill={color.grayA}
                name="plus-circle-outline"
                title="Settings" />)
            button at the bottom right corner of the extension.  To save your configuration, click on the save icon (
            <Icon
                iconWidth="20"
                iconHeight="15"
                fill={color.grayA}
                name="save-outline"
                title="Settings" />) on the top navigation bar of the extension.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
                <figure>
